Basic implementation of ray tracing algorithms in C++

Simulates the way light interacts with objects in a scene to produce highly realistic images. It traces the path of rays of light as they travel from a light source, interact with objects (via reflections, refractions, or shadows), and finally hits the virtual camera or viewer. Reflectance (Fractional reflectance and Lambertian reflectance), Reflection, internal reflection and defocus blur are all simulated for different materials.
