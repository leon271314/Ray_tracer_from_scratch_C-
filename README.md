Basic implementation of ray tracing algorithms in C++

Ray tracing is a rendering technique used in computer graphics to simulate the way light interacts with objects in a scene to produce highly realistic images. It traces the path of rays of light as they travel from a light source, interact with objects (via reflections, refractions, or shadows), and finally hit the virtual camera or viewer.
